## Organization (while work is ongoing)

-   Issues contain elements of the preregistration that are to be done. 
-   Each issue is assigned to a project. 
-   Code for each project gets placed in ./projectname/ directory

## Code

Each projects code

-   ./esfmri_connectivity/projectname/

In the README of each directory it should be clearly stated which data it is acting on and contain a list or execution order. If a Dockerfile has been used for a specific part of the analysis (e.g. fMRIPrep) this should be stated. If nothing is specified, then the main ./Dockerfile is used.
