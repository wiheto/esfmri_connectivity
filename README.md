### Organization (while work is ongoing): 

- Issues contain elements of the preregistration that are to be done. 
- Each issue is assigned to a project. 
- Code for each project gets placed in ./<projectname>/ directory

### Code: 

Each projects code

- ./<projectname>/

In the README of each directory it should be clearly stated which data it is acting on and contain a list or execution order. If a Dockerfile has been used for a specific part of the analysis (e.g. fMRIPrep) this should be stated. If nothing is specified, then the main ./DockerFile is used.
