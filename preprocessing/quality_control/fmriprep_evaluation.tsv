sub-331	0	n/a	larger frontmid artifact. also stripe artifact/distortion across anat.	
sub-334	0	n/a	larger frontmid artifact. stripe artifact/distortion across anat. 	n/a
sub-335	1	n/a	n/a	both hemispheres show an artifact. if only one hemisphere is going to be used in an analysis, then this subject should be rejected. 
sub-339	1	n/a	n/a	could be rejected if only single hemisphere is to be used as the artifact extends over both hemispheres. but with parcel-wise rejection could be ok.
sub-352	0	n/a	poor registration	some parts of the cortex could be recoverable. but artifact seems too extensive to be used
sub-357	1	task-es_run-6,task-es_run-7,task-es_run-8,task-es_run-9,task-es_run-10,task-es_run-11	run 9 and 10 are very short. run 6-8 have part of cortex cut off

sub-372	1	task-rest_run-1,task-rest_run-2,task-rest_run-3	preop rest had top of cortex cut off	amount of cut off is small in preop session and might be useable in some contexts
sub-376	1	n/a	n/a	n/a
sub-384	0	n/a	slight distrotion in anatomical image. considerable dropout covering both hemispheres	n/a
sub-394	1	tast-es_run-2,	very short runs	n/a
sub-395	0	n/a	registration over both hemispheres has considerable noise	n/a
sub-399	1	n/a	n/a	n/a
sub-400	1	tast-es_run-4	run 4 is too short (14 vols long)	could be rejected if only single hemisphere is to be used as the artifact extends over both hemispheres. but with parcel-wise rejection could be ok.
sub-403	1	tast-es_run-4,tast-es_run-5,tast-es_run-6	part off cortext cut off. run 5 also too short	n/a
